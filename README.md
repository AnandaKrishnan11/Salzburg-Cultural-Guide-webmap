🌍 Web Mapping with Leaflet
1. Introduction
This project demonstrates building an interactive web map using Leaflet.js, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly maps. The goal was to display geographic data—such as markers and GeoJSON layers—with interactivity like popups and custom styling. It’s a lightweight alternative to heavier GIS solutions, perfect for web development and academic assignments.
